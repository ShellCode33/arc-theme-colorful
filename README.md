# Arc Theme Colorful

Arc is a flat theme with transparent elements for GTK 3, GTK 2 and various desktop shells, window managers and applications. It's well suited for GTK based desktop environments such as GNOME, Cinnamon, Xfce, Unity, MATE, Budgie etc.

This project is a fork of [jnsh's repo](https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme), which is the maintained fork of the [original Arc theme by horst3180](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme).

What you will find here is basically the same Arc theme you are used to, but with different color variants.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only the GTK themes have been tested, but my guess is that the other themes should work fine as well.

## Installation

Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/ShellCode33/arc-theme-colorful/releases/latest) and download the archive for the color your want.

The downloaded archive will contain all four variants: `Light`, `Dark`, `Lighter` and `Darker`.

Go to your `themes` folder and extract the archive in there:

```
$ cd ~/.local/share/themes/
$ mv ~/Downloads/arc-theme-COLOR.tar.gz .
$ tar -xf arc-theme-COLOR.tar.gz
```

You should see that four folders popped up:

```
$ ls ~/.local/share/themes/
Arc-Red       Arc-Red-Darker   Arc-Red-Dark
Arc-Red-Lighter  arc-theme-red.tar.gz
```

You should now be able to change your theme the same way you are used to.
